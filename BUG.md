## CASSINI-001 — APT adapter fails to compile for `ExceptionMapper<E extends Throwable>` (and bounded type-variable params)
- **Date**: 2026-06-01 — **Status**: FIXED
- **Severity**: medium (any `@Provider`/resource whose method has a bounded type-variable parameter,
  notably `ExceptionMapper<Throwable>`)
- **Surfaced by**: Arago (a diagnostic `@Provider ExceptionMapper<Throwable>`).

### Symptom
Compiling a class implementing `ExceptionMapper<Throwable>` with the cassini-processor on the
annotation-processor path failed:
`BoomMapper$$CassiniAdapter.java: incompatible types: java.lang.Object cannot be converted to java.lang.Throwable`.

### Cause
`CassiniResourceProcessor` collected the interface's abstract `toResponse(E)` (a type variable) in
addition to the concrete `toResponse(Throwable)` override. It erased the type variable `E` to
`java.lang.Object` (hardcoded in `javaTypeName`, `jvmBinaryName`, `toJvmDescriptor`), so:
1. the de-dup signature (`(Ljava/lang/Object;)…`) differed from the concrete override
   (`(Ljava/lang/Throwable;)…`), so both were emitted; and
2. the extra invoke case generated `target.toResponse((Object) args[0])`, which does not compile —
   the bean only declares `toResponse(Throwable)`.

The runtime/plugin generators (reflection-based, `RuntimeAdapterGenerator`) were unaffected: they see
the concrete `toResponse(Throwable)` override directly and filter bridge methods.

### Fix
A type variable now erases to its **leftmost bound** (`types.erasure(...)`), not to `Object`:
`E extends Throwable` → `Throwable`. The cast becomes `(Throwable) args[0]` (valid) and the interface
method's signature matches the concrete override, so it de-dups to a single invoke case. Unbounded
type variables still erase to `Object` (unchanged). Regression:
`CassiniResourceProcessorTest.processorGeneratesAdapterForExceptionMapperOfThrowable`.
REST 4.0 TCK preserved: 2535 PASS / 135 SKIP.

## CASSINI-002 — Request-remapping wrappers silently drop per-request attributes
- **Date**: 2026-06-11 — **Status**: FIXED
- **Severity**: low before M2h (latent — nothing flowed through the wrappers' attributes);
  high during M2h (3 SecurityContext TCK tests errored)
- **Surfaced by**: the M2h ThreadLocal→ScopedValue migration (auth handed over via Chappe
  per-request attributes instead of an InheritableThreadLocal).

### Symptom
After migrating `CURRENT_AUTH` to a Chappe request attribute (`cassini.auth`), the REST TCK
errored on `requestcontext.security.getSecurityContextTest` and
`securitycontext.basic.basicAuthorization{Admin,StandardUser}Test`: the resource saw an
anonymous SecurityContext although `BasicAuthHandler` had validated the credentials.

### Cause
Three anonymous `Request` wrappers (context-prefix remapping in
`VidocqCassiniDeployableContainer`, `CassiniTestHarness.ContextStrippingHandler`, and
`ChappeRuntimeDelegate`) override the path/context methods but not
`attribute(String)`/`attribute(String, Object)`. The Chappe interface defaults for those are
**no-ops** (`return null` / `return this`), so any attribute written by an upstream handler on
the wrapped request was silently dropped before reaching `ChappeHttpExchange`.

### Fix
The three wrappers now delegate both `attribute` methods to the wrapped request.
`ChappeHttpExchange.getAttribute` also falls back to the Chappe request attributes, so
upstream handlers can hand state to Cassini across the per-request virtual-thread boundary.
REST 4.0 TCK: 2535 PASS / 135 SKIP / 0 ERROR.
